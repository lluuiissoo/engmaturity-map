# Tier System


| Tier | Description | Target Bar |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 (red)      | Revenue-critical, customer-facing | Aggressive: mostly 4-5 across customer-facing |
| Tier 2 (orange)   | Important supporting services     | Moderate: mostly 3-4                          |
| Tier 3 (yellow)   | Internal, low-risk, experimental  | Resonable: mostly 2-3                         |

## Org-wide minimums — the absolute floor regardless of tier.
No repo should be allowed to stay below these.


## How to apply
Org-wide minimums act as a floor — no sub-dimension target drops below the
minimum regardless of tier. Security-related minimums are set at 3 (Secret
Mgmt, Vuln Mgmt), CI/CD at 3, Code Review at 3.
